TweakForge is an educational, accessible and friendly app that beginners dip their toes into scripting, and potentially make life easier for experienced people (say, someone who fresh installs windows often).

apps that already exist tend to run entirely in the command line and are well documented on their respective GitHub pages. this is largely a good thing, however it is not very accessible to non-technical people. (almost) everyone has access to a browser, so here TweakForge offers a solution - a place where you can tick boxes to get the scripts that you want, and the instructions to run them. no ps1 (PowerShell) scripts executing behind the scenes.

TweakForge was designed so that users have to be very deliberate with their execution. I have also made an attempt to break down scripts, so that each step explains what it does. 

Remember, do not run scripts you don't fully understand!
