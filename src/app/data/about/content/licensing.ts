AGPL-3.0 was chosen to protect users and the integrity of TweakForge while maintaining the spirit of open source. Since TweakForge helps users modify their Windows registry, it could be catastrophic if a bad actor cloned it and changed the scripts to be malicious.

With AGPL-3.0, anyone who copies, modifies, and hosts TweakForge (which they are welcome to do) legally must disclose ALL changes publicly. This means any malicious scripts would be visible in their repository.

This isn't foolproof—illegal actors will ignore licenses—but it discourages "grey area" operators and gives us legal grounds for DMCA takedowns.

**Always verify you're using the official site: tweakforge.tools**

### What Makes AGPL Different?

Most open source licenses (like MIT or GPL) only require sharing changes if you **distribute** the software (like giving someone a download).

AGPL goes further: If you **host** modified code as a web service (like TweakForge), that counts as distribution. You must share your changes even if users never download anything.

This is crucial for web apps, where traditional licenses have a loophole.
