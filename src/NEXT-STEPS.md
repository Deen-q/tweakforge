# High Priority
- about page: talk about respect for accessibility, e.g., you can use the app with just a keyboard!
- new dropdown: briefly describe what each icon means
- right next to checkbox, a ? or 'i' button -> display modal that shows a ss of what it's referring to? extra entry in checkboxOptions
- onHover when the (currently) dummy links (in nav bar) are hovered over
    - make links unclickable if already of said page 
- Disable copy buttons for 1 second after initial click - prevent abuse (toasts will likely be added)
- should probably make click change colour to something more obvious like green - investigate accessibility for colour blindness
- Upgrade GitHub Actions pipeline (more tests and new Docker image on push to main)

# Low(er) Priority
- implement suitable client vs server components
- if search terms don't retrieve a script, mention "no scripts found"
- perhaps improve the search further, but even when the app is done, I doubt there would be THAT many scripts total
