- reconsider if the entire PrefSelection should move as much as it does when a toggle is toggled. or if it is too early to consider that since the width of the selection + checked scripts will likely be larger in the future (making more horizontal space for dropdown text, preventing the box from raising further up)
- tests: starting off with the scripts being in the correct format (line breaks). and perhaps if the copy button works
- have a reverse script option - probably make that a copy button next to the copy button
- scroll on script features
- implement suitable client vs server components

- about page: talk about respect for accessibility, e.g., you can use the app with just a keyboard!
